about: You want to request an upload file-size limit increase
labels: "limit request"

<!--
If you can't upload your project's release to PyPI because you're hitting the
upload file size limit, we can sometimes increase your limit.

Make sure you've uploaded at least one release for the project that's under the
limit (a developmental release version number is fine).
-->

**Project**
<!--
Provide the name of the package and a link to its
PyPI page, i.e. https://pypi.org/project/<PROJECT>
-->

**Size of release**
<!--
The size of your release, in megabytes, that is above the limit.
-->

**Which indexes**
<!--
Which index/indexes you need the increase for (PyPI, Test PyPI, or both)
-->

**Reasons for the request**
<!--
A description of the project, and the reason for the additional size.

If you expect your release sizes to increase in the future, mention it here.
